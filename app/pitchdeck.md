Backyard i/o: Y Combinator Pitch Deck
Slide 1: Company & Tagline
Backyard i/o
Powering Augmented Futures. Starting with Streamers.

Slide 2: The Problem
Modern workflows, especially for high-performance users like streamers, are increasingly complex, energy-hungry, and inefficiently managed. As AI agents and robotics integrate further, this problem will explode. Current solutions are fragmented, lack intelligence, and don't offer the granular control needed for dynamic, augmented environments.

Slide 3: Our Solution
We're building intelligent energy interfaces that provide dynamic power management and optimization. Think of it as a Stream Deck, but for energy. Our initial product empowers streamers with smart control over their entire setup's power, leading to efficiency, stability, and new workflow possibilities.

Slide 4: How It Works (The Tech)
Our solution combines:

Custom Hardtech: Smart power delivery units (initial prototypes using ESP32 for control).

Advanced Power Electronics: For efficient energy distribution and monitoring.

AI/Software Layer: Intuitive control via mobile apps (Android Kotlin, React Native Expo) and future integration with workflow automation.

Iterative Development: Starting simple, evolving into complex, sci-fi-level energy management.

Slide 5: The Market
Initial Target: The rapidly growing global market of professional and aspiring streamers (millions of users). They are early adopters of complex tech and demand peak performance.

Future Vision: Expand to a much larger market of "augmented machines" – AI workstations, robotics, smart home ecosystems, and industrial automation, as they increasingly require sophisticated energy interfacing.

Slide 6: Traction (What We've Done So Far)
Deep Domain Expertise: BSc in Computing Honors, 5+ years of hands-on electronics repair, flipping, and freelance computing projects.

Bootstrapped R&D: Actively generating income through electronics repairs, flipping, dropshipping, and remote development to self-fund initial hardtech R&D.

Early Audience Building: Establishing an online presence as a "hardware hacker" and "tech reviewer" (Twitch/socials) to gather insights and build a community of enthusiasts and early adopters.

Validated Pain Points: Through direct engagement and repair work, confirming critical energy management issues for streamers.

Initial Tech Stack Readiness: Actively prototyping with ESP32 and developing mobile app components.

Slide 7: Our Team
[Your Name]: Founder. BSc Computing Honors. Deep passion for electronics, proven resourcefulness in bootstrapping, hands-on experience in hardware and software development, and a clear vision for the future of augmented machines. (Currently a solo founder, seeking future electrical engineering partner).

Slide 8: The Vision (The "Sci-Fi" Future)
We envision a future where every augmented machine – from AI agents and robotics to advanced personal computing setups – seamlessly interfaces with and optimizes its energy consumption. Backyard i/o will be the foundational hardtech layer enabling this new era of intelligent, efficient, and powerful automated workflows. This is about building the energy infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.

Slide 9: Competition
Existing smart power strips (lack deep integration, AI, and future vision).

Generic power solutions (not optimized for specific workflows or augmented machines).

DIY solutions (lack scalability, robust design, and user-friendly interface).

Our differentiator is the holistic integration of intelligent control, a deep understanding of workflow needs, and a long-term vision for augmented machine energy interfacing.

Slide 10: The Ask
(In a real pitch, this would be specific. For now, it's implied: we're building traction and seeking early support/feedback to accelerate our journey towards a seed round.)
